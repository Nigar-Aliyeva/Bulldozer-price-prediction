# Definition
In this project, I am trying to accurately forecast the future selling price of a bulldozer by analyzing its attributes and past sales data of comparable bulldozers.It utilizes the scikit-learn `RandomForestRegressor()` model, and the evaluation is performed using the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) metric. Following hyperparameter tuning, the project achieved a final RMSLE score of 0.24 points.
