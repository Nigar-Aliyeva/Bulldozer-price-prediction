## ðŸ’  Definition
In this project, I am trying to accurately forecast the future selling price of a bulldozer by analyzing its attributes and past sales data of comparable bulldozers.It utilizes the scikit-learn `RandomForestRegressor()` model, and the evaluation is performed using the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) metric. Following hyperparameter tuning, the project achieved a final RMSLE score of 0.24 points.

## ðŸ’  Data
The original data is uploaded from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).

## ðŸ’  Feature importance 
Furthermore, the feature importance has been tested as well.
